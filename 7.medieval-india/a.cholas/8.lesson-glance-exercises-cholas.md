SECTION 7: THE LESSON AT A GLANCE + EXERCISES

We have travelled through the Chola world: from copper-plate grants to granite temples, from Rajaraja’s Big Temple to Rajendra’s overseas expeditions, from village assemblies to saintly poets. Now let us pause and see the whole picture — like standing on a hilltop and looking back at the landscape below.

THE CHOLAS IN BRIEF – A MEMORY SNAPSHOT
• Origins – The Cholas began in the fertile Kaveri delta. Vijayalaya Chola made Thanjavur the capital in the 9th century.  
• Duration – They ruled for nearly 433 years (9th to 13th century CE).  
• Rivals – Alongside them flourished the Cheras (Kerala coast, spice trade) and the Pandyas (Madurai, pearls and poetry). In the north, Rashtrakutas and Chalukyas were constant rivals.  
• Great Rulers – Parantaka I (Pandya conqueror), Rajaraja I (temple builder, sea king), Rajendra I (Ganga conqueror, overseas expeditions), Rajadhiraja (brave but died in battle).  
• Administration – Highly organised: King at the centre, empire divided into mandalams → kottams → nadus → kurrams → villages. Village assemblies (Ur, Sabha, Nattar, Nagattar) show democratic elements. Revenue mainly from land (1/3 produce). Temples were not just religious centres but employers, schools, and record-keepers.  
• Social Life – Based on varna divisions (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Sudras). Slavery and bonded labour existed. Artisans (weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, masons) thrived. Temples doubled as schools and libraries.  
• Art – Temples in Dravidian style: Brihadeshwara (Thanjavur) and Gangaikonda Cholapuram as finest examples. Bronze sculptures, especially Nataraja, show unmatched artistic skill. Temples became cultural hubs.  
• Literature – Bhakti poets (Nayanars for Shiva, Alvars for Vishnu) created Tirumarai, called the “Fifth Veda.” Great poets: Kamban (Tamil Ramayana), Jayamkondar (*Kalingattupparani*), Sekkilar (*Periyapuranam*), Ottakuttan (court poet). Jain poet Ravivarman wrote *Nannul* (grammar).  

👉 Memory hook for revision: “River, Rulers, Revenue, Religion, Records, Ramayana.”  
(River = Kaveri, Rulers = Rajaraja & Rajendra, Revenue = land tax, Religion = temples, Records = inscriptions, Ramayana = Kamban.)

WHY THIS SECTION MATTERS
This final recap helps you “compress” a huge chapter into a compact form. Exams don’t only test memory — they test **clarity**.  
If you can recall the big names, connect them with the right achievements, and link administration + society + art + literature, you will always have enough material to frame a solid answer.

EXAM STRATEGY TIPS
• For 1-mark questions → remember key words (e.g., “Uttaramerur inscription,” “Brihadeshwara,” “Kamban”).  
• For 3-mark questions → give 3 points: name, achievement, why important.  
• For 5-mark or long answers → structure into 3 parts: introduction (time + king), body (points), conclusion (why it mattered).
