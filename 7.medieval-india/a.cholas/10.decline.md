SECTION 10: DECLINE OF THE CHOLAS

Every empire has its sunrise and sunset. For the Cholas, the sunrise was Vijayalaya in the 9th century, the golden noon was Rajaraja and Rajendra, and the sunset began after Rajadhiraja fell in battle in 1052 CE. Let us walk slowly through how this mighty empire declined and eventually disappeared.

CAUSES OF DECLINE – WHY THE SUN SET
1. Weak Successors  
   After Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, the later kings did not have the same vision or strength. Rajadhiraja died in battle; later rulers like Rajaraja II and Rajaraja III were unable to control the vast empire.  

2. Endless Wars  
   The Cholas were always at war — especially with the **Western Chalukyas** in the Deccan and the **Pandyas** in the south. Constant fighting drained resources and weakened the empire’s stability.  

3. Rise of Rivals  
   - **Pandyas** regained strength and often defeated Chola armies.  
   - **Hoysalas** (in Karnataka) grew powerful and took over parts of Chola territory.  
   - **Eastern Chalukyas** (though once allied by marriage) became independent.  

4. Decline of Naval Power and Trade  
   Overseas trade routes in the Bay of Bengal shifted. Control over Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia weakened. Without dominance at sea, the Cholas lost one of their unique advantages.  

5. Invasions from the North  
   Finally, the Delhi Sultanate extended its reach. In 1311 CE, **Malik Kafur**, general of Alauddin Khalji, invaded Tamil Nadu. His army defeated local rulers, plundered temples, and delivered the last blow to an already weakened Chola power.  

👉 Memory hook: “Weak Kings, Endless Wars, Strong Rivals, Lost Seas, Delhi Invasion.”

LATER CHOLAS – TRYING TO HOLD ON
After Rajendra I, several rulers kept the throne but with declining influence:  
- **Rajadhiraja I (1018–1054)** – died in battle against Western Chalukyas.  
- **Rajendra II (1052–1064)** and **Virarajendra (1063–1070)** – tried to keep power but fought constant wars.  
- **Kulottunga I (1070–1120)** – gave some stability; remembered for long rule and literature patronage.  
- **Kulottunga II, Rajaraja II, Kulottunga III** – later rulers who faced growing Pandya and Hoysala threats.  
- **Rajaraja III (1216–1246)** – weak ruler, humiliated by the Pandyas.  
- **Rajendra III (1246–1279)** – the last Chola king, who lost most of his territory to the Pandyas.  

👉 After Rajendra III, the Cholas vanish from political history. The Pandya dynasty absorbed their lands, and by the time Malik Kafur invaded in 1311 CE, the Cholas were only a memory.

THE END OF THE DYNASTY
By the early 13th century, the Chola kingdom had collapsed. The once mighty rulers of land and sea had become powerless chieftains. Temples like Brihadeshwara still stood tall, but the roar of the tiger flag no longer flew over South India.

WHY THIS SECTION MATTERS
- It teaches that no empire lasts forever — power declines if leadership weakens and rivals rise.  
- It shows how politics, economy, and geography all contribute to decline, not just one battle.  
- It reminds us that though the Chola kingdom ended, their art, temples, and literature keep them alive.  

MEMORY ANCHORS
• Decline causes = Weak kings, Endless wars, Strong rivals, Lost seas, Delhi invasion.  
• Last ruler = Rajendra III (ended ~1279 CE).  
• Final blow = Malik Kafur’s invasion in 1311 CE.  

EXAM PRACTICE
- **Recall:** Who was the last Chola ruler?  
- **Understand:** Why did the loss of naval dominance weaken the Cholas?  
- **Connect:** Compare the decline of the Cholas with the decline of the Guptas — what similarities do you notice?
