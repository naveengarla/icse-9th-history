SECTION 3: THE CHOLA ADMINISTRATION

Imagine standing in the great city of Thanjavur during the reign of Rajaraja I. The streets are alive with traders, temple bells ring, and soldiers march past. But behind all this activity is a carefully woven system of rule — the Chola administration. It was so efficient that even today historians admire it. Let us step into that world, piece by piece.

THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT – THE KING AT THE CENTRE
At the top of the system stood the king.  
He was not just a warrior on horseback or a temple builder — he was the **central authority** who held the threads of the entire empire.  
- He was the head of the **administrative machinery** (like today’s Prime Minister + President combined).  
- He made sure the **welfare of the people** was taken care of — especially during crises like famines, floods, or wars.  
- He was helped by a **council of ministers** [a group of high officials who advised and implemented orders].  

Officials had two categories:  
- **Peruntaram** (senior/high-ranking officers).  
- **Siruntaram** (junior/lower officers).  

👉 Memory hook: “Perun = big, Sirun = small.”  
These words are Tamil and easy to remember if you link them this way.  

Think of the king as the **heart**, pumping energy to all other organs of the empire. But a heart cannot work alone — it needs veins and arteries. Those were the provinces and villages.

THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT – DIVIDING A HUGE EMPIRE
The Chola empire was vast, so it was divided for easier management.  

- The biggest division was called a **Mandalam** [Mandalam = province; like today’s “state”]. There were six major mandalams.  
- Each mandalam was looked after by a **viceroy** [viceroy = deputy ruler, usually a member of the royal family placed in charge of that province]. This made sure loyalty stayed in the family.  

Inside a mandalam:  
- It was divided into **Kottams** [smaller divisions; think of them like “district zones”].  
- Each kottam was divided into **Nadus** [districts].  
- Each nadu was divided further into **Kurrams or Tehsils** [a group of villages].  
- And at the very bottom were **villages**.  

👉 Memory hook: “Mandalam → Kottam → Nadu → Kurram → Village.”  
Like a nesting doll, big to small.  

LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT – THE PRIDE OF THE CHOLAS
This is what made the Cholas different from most medieval kingdoms.  
They gave **real power to villages** through assemblies. This is why historians call it “a democratic spark” in medieval India.  

Villages and kurrams were governed by **panchayats** [councils of respected villagers]. These assemblies were not symbolic — they had actual decision-making power.  

The textbook mentions **four kinds of assemblies**:  
1. **Nattar** – district-level assembly, decided cases and disputes.  
2. **Nagattar** – merchants’ assembly, looked after **trade and commerce**.  
3. **Ur** – general village assembly, handled common village issues.  
4. **Sabha** – specialised village assembly, usually in Brahmin villages (called Brahmadeya), took care of temple administration, donations, and land management.  

👉 Memory hook: “Nattar = disputes, Nagattar = trade, Ur = village, Sabha = temples.”  

And yes — these assemblies were **elected**. The **Uttaramerur inscription** explains this in detail: who could stand for election, how names were drawn, and how terms were limited.  
Imagine little palm-leaf chits with names being dropped into a pot and drawn out — like a lottery system for democracy, 1,000 years ago!  

REVENUE – THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE
No administration works without money. For the Cholas, revenue came mainly from **land tax**.  

- The main rate was **one-third of the produce** (what the farmer grew).  
- Merchants also paid taxes on goods and profits.  
- The revenue was spent on:
  • Administration (paying officials).  
  • Salaries of soldiers.  
  • Public works (tanks, canals, temples, roads).  

Temples often received land grants called **Devadana** [land gifted to temples] or **Brahmadeya** [land gifted to Brahmins]. Sometimes instead of gifting land, the **revenue from a village** was directly assigned to a temple.  
This made temples rich, but also made them **employers** — they hired priests, teachers, dancers, sculptors, guards, cooks, and labourers. Temples were thus not only religious centres but also **economic and social hubs**.  

PUBLIC WORKS – THE WELFARE ARM
The Cholas had something like a **Public Works Department (PWD)**. Its job was to build and maintain:  
- Roads and bridges.  
- New cities and temples.  
- Dams, tanks, lakes, and canals for irrigation.  

Irrigation was especially important in the Kaveri delta. Without canals and tanks, no rice could grow. A famous example is the 16-mile embankment built by **Rajendra I** around a huge lake near his new capital.

MILITARY ORGANISATION – THE SHIELD OF THE EMPIRE
Finally, the Chola military.  
To guard such a vast empire, the Cholas maintained a strong, multi-branch army:  
- **Infantry** (foot soldiers).  
- **Cavalry** (horsemen).  
- **Elephants** (used like tanks — to break enemy lines).  
- **Navy** (their pride; controlled seas, supported overseas campaigns, and kept trade routes safe).  

No other Indian dynasty of their time invested in a navy as much as the Cholas did. This gave them an edge in controlling Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian trade routes.

WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION MATTERS
- It shows the Cholas were not just conquerors but also skilled organisers.  
- Their village assemblies are among the earliest **examples of local self-government** in India.  
- Their irrigation works supported one of the richest agricultural economies of the time.  
- Their navy made them unique among Indian dynasties.  

MEMORY ANCHORS
• King = central authority, Peruntaram (big officials), Siruntaram (small officials).  
• Provinces = Mandalams → Kottams → Nadus → Kurrams → Villages.  
• Assemblies = Nattar (disputes), Nagattar (trade), Ur (village), Sabha (temple).  
• Land revenue = 1/3 produce.  
• Temples = economic + cultural hubs.  
• PWD = tanks, canals, roads.  
• Army = infantry, cavalry, elephants, navy.  

EXAM PRACTICE
- **Recall:** What was the main source of Chola revenue, and at what rate was it collected?  
- **Understand:** Why do historians call Chola village administration a “democratic spark”?  
- **Connect:** Compare the Chola Sabha with today’s Gram Sabha. How are they similar?
