6 The Golden Age of the Guptas 
The rise of the Guptas marked a significant turning 
point in Indian history, bringing stability and unity to 
northern India. Although the Gupta Empire covered 
smaller geographic area than the Mauryan Empire, 
it is often considered more stable and enduring. The 
dynasty was founded by Srigupta, a minor chief, who 
laid the foundation for the Imperial Age of the Guptas, 
a remarkable period of progress that spanned about two 
dynasty. Various sources, both literary and archaeological, 
provide knowledge and information about the Gupta

) Fa-hein's Account-Fa-hien, a Chinese 
Buddhist pilgrim, visited India during the reign 
of Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya). During his 
pilgrimage, he travelled to Mathura, Kannauj, 
Kapilavastu, Kushinagar, Vaishali, Pataliputra, Kashi, 
and Rajagriha. Although his primary interest was 
in Buddhism, he wrote extensively about the Gupta 
king, his administration, and the social, economic, and 
religious conditions of India during the Gupta period. 
According to Fa-Hien: SOURCES 
Magadha was a prosperous region with large 
towns and a wealthy population. 
Pataliputra was a flourishing city with 
numerous charitable institutions, including a 
hospital funded by benevolent citizens. 
The people, despite their wealth, led simple lives 
and generally adhered to Buddhist principles. 
Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Buddhism, and 
Jainism were the main religions, and people 
lived harmoniously without ill will toward 
other sects. 
Hindu gods and goddesses were depicted on 
coins, as well as in sculptures and paintings. 
The penal code was mild, with most offences 
punishable by fines.

especially of Kalidasa and Vishakhadatta have proved 
very useful regarding the Gupta rulers and the state 
of society under them. Kalidasa's masterpiece is 
the play Abhijanasakuntalam. Vishakhadatta's Devi

Vayu Purana, give some very useful information 
regarding the Gupta dynasty.

most important source of information regarding 
Samudragupta is the inscription found on the Ashokan 
Pillar, which stands in the Allahabad fort. This 
inscription, also known as the Prayaga Prashasti, 
was written in Sanskrit by Harisena. He was the

Chandragupta II and his reign. Very useful 
information about Chandragupta II's conquests is 
derived from this inscription. 
(3) Many Other Inscriptions-In addition to the 
above two main inscriptions, various other inscriptions 
have also been found that throw an important light 
on the Gupta dynasty. Of all these inscriptions those 
found at Basarh, Udaygiri and Sanchi have proved 
very useful regarding Chandragupta II, while the Eran 
inscription throws some useful light on Skandgupta.

of the Gupta Era and significantly enhanced the

Samudragupta (335 -375 CE) 'Befy 
Chandragupta 1 I was succeeded by his illustrious 
son and one of the ablest kings of ancient India, 
Samudragupta. In the north, he extended his empire 
up to the Chambal River after defeating the Naga 
Kings of Mathura, Gwalior, and Ahichhatra. His 
most important military exploit was his Deccan 
campaign. He covered a long distance of 3,000 
miles through dense forests with the same boldness 
as that of Alexander l and Napoleon. While marching 
towards the south, he defeated several powerful rulers 
including some confederacies. However, he did not 
annex any portion of the Deccan, as it would make 
his empire too big to i rule. He felt content to make 
the southern kings accept his suzerainty, showing that 
he was a wise statesman. 
Samudragupta playing the Veena 
Samudragupta is said to have subjugated the 
forest tribes dwelling Central India and defeated 
nine republican tribes of Rajasthan. The five 
trontier states (1) Samtata or modern Bengal, 
2) Devaka or modern North Assam, (3) Kamrup 
or Assam, (4) Nepal, and (5) Kartarpur or modern 
Terat Region accepted his suzerainty and paid him 
beavy tributes. He maintained friendly relations with 
heighbouring states like the Shakas, the Kushanas, the 
hahis of Punjab, and the king of Sri Lanka, Megha 
Vertnan. Some of these rulers also paid him tributes. tiN because of his great military exploits that atmudragupta is generally compared with Napoleon. 
and Civics IX His empire extended fromn the Brahmaputra in the 
cast to the Yamnuna and Chambal rivers in the west 
and from the Himalayas in the north to the Narmada 
in the south. 
The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta 
provides valuable insights into his conquests and 
policies. It categoriscs rulers into four groups based 
on his dealings with them: 
1. Rulers of Aryavarta: Nine rulers were 
defeated, and their kingdoms were incorporated into 
Samudragupta's empire. 
2. Rulers of Dakshinpatha (South India): Twelve 
rulers, after being defeated, surrendered to h√≠m but were 
allowed to rule their kingdoms as subordinate allies. 
3. Neigh bouring States: States such as Assam, 
Coastal Bengal, Nepal, and several gana sanghas 
(Republics) in the northwest paid tribute, obeyed his 
orders, and attended his court. 
4. Outlying Rulers: Kings of distant regions 
submitted to him, offering tributes and matrimonial 
alliances. 
An Estimate of Samudragupta 
Samudragupta's court poet Harisena records that 
he performed an Ashvamnedha Yajna (horse sacrifice) 
to assert his sovereignty. He was a great conqueror 
and rightly deserves to be called the Indian Napoleon. 
He was also a great patron and lover of art and 
literature. He himself was a great musician and 
an expert Veena player. Some of his coins feature 
artistic descriptions of him playing the Veena. He was 
an accomplished scholar and a poet of high order. 
Samudragupta was a follower of Hinduism, but his 
greatness lies in the fact that he was equally tolerant 
towards other religions. In conclusion, Samudragupta 
was a versatile genius and possessed exceptional 
qualities of head and heart.

Chandragupta Il succeeded his fther, Samudragupta, and expanded the Gupta Empire through conquest. He annexed the territories of tthe Sakas in Malwa, Gujaral, 
and Saurashtra, caming the title 'Shakari (Conqueror of the Sakas). This annexation added wealth and fertile 
provinces to the empire, providing access to westen ports such as Broach, Cambay, and Sopara, which enhanced trade with Europe via Egypt. His empire stretched from the Brahmaputra River in the cast to the Chenab River in the west, and from the Himalayas in the north to the Namada River in the south. 
Chandragupta II 
(Vikramaditya) 
Chandragupta II also used matrimonial alliances 
to strengthen his rule. His marriage to Kuberanaga of the Naga family and his daughter Prabhavati's 
marriage to Vakataka ruler Rudrasena II extended 
Gupta influence into the Deccan. 
During his reign, the Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hien 
visited India, providing insights into the life and 
conditions of the time. Chandragupta issued gold 
coins, some depicting him slaying a lion with the 
The Gupta period marked a shift from the 
centralised Mauryan administration to a decentralised 
system. The Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hien praised the

Transition to Feudal Governance 
The Gupta administration exhibited a gradual 
devolution of state authority. Key functions such as tax 
collection, law enforcement, and agriculture regulation, 
once centralised, were increasingly delegated to the 
priestly and warrior classes. This decentralisation marked 
a transition towards a feudal system, distinguishing it 
from the centralised governance of the Mauryan Empire. 
Society :A Highly ldeal and Moral Society 
Fa-hien's account reveals that people were rich 
and prosperous and donated to religious and charitable 
causes, such as setting up rest houses and hospitals. 
They were honest and law-abiding. Mostly, people 
were vegetarian except for the Chandalas who lived 
outside the towns and were treated as untouchables. 
All the other castes lived in harmony.

Religion : Full Religious Toleration 
The Gupta kings practised Hinduism and under their patronage, Hinduism flourished significantly. The Guptas worshipped Lord Vishnu. They also performed religious sacrifices. The Gupta kings gave liberal donations for building temples. The Brahmanas were held in high esteem. They laid emphasis on the devotion of Vishnu through prayers and hymns. Like that of Buddhism, images of gods and goddesses (like Shiva, Shakti and Vishnu) began to be worshipped. For their worship, special rooms, called 'Deva-grihas' were constructed in temples. The 'avatara cult related to Lord Vishnu also became 
Gupta rulers were not only great generals and able administrators but also patrons of art and literature. Under them, India saw advancement in all the fields of culture literature, science, sculpture, fine arts etc., as it had not seen before. That is why their period is regarded as a 'Golden Period in the History of Ancient India. 
Advancement in the Field of Literature 
This period is particularly renowned for advancement in literature. Sanskrit saw its revival during this period. 
Sanskrit became more prominent in Gupta times, 
especially in the courts and classical literature, while 
Pali was still widely used in Buddhist scriptures. 
Many great poets, dramatists, grammarians and 
scholars lived in the period. The chief among them 
were the following: CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
1. Kalidasa : He was the greatest poet and 
playwright of this age. He is often referred to as the 
Shakespeare of India'. He wrote several poems and 
drama in Sanskrit which are considered the gems of 
literature. His great skill in lyrical poetry is exhibited 
in his poems Meghaduta and Ritusamhara while 
Kumarasambhava and Raghuvamsha are his two 
great epics. Kalidasa's plays have also been translated 
into various languages of the world. The most 
important among them are Abhijnanshakuntalam, 
Vikramorvashi and Malavikagnimitra.

2, Vishakhadatta : He was a great playwn 
who wrote two great historical plays Mudrarak 
and the Devi Chandraguptam. Mudrarakshasa ort 'Seal of Rakshasa' is the story of the circumstane 
that led to the accession of Chandragupta Maurai 
the throne of Magadha. 
3. Shudraka : He wrote the famous 
Mrichchhakatikam or the Clay Cart' which s 
great source of information about the socio-qultu 
conditions of that period. 
4. Other Poets, Dramatists and Playwr 
Among the other great poets and playwTgs 
this period were Harisena who wrote the tau 
poem praising the valour of his patron Emy 
Samudragupta. It is a gem of Sanskrit poetry whd 
inscribed on the Allahabad Pillar. Bharavi and D 
were also great poets and playwrights. Kiratarji

Bhasa Wrote e 13 plays, of which Svapana-lasavdatta 
or the Dream of Princess Vasavadatta' and Pratigva 
Jogandhana are the nost popular. Ravana ladha or 
the Assassination of Ravana written by Bhatti is 
also a masterpicce of literature. 
Dandin was also a versatile writer, and his 
Dashkumarcharita describes the adventures of ten 
princes in lucid prose. These adventures provide us 
a lot of information about the social condition of that 
period. 
During the Gupta period, the Sanskrit grammar 
was systematised by the efforts of grammarians 
1:ke Patanj ali and lexicographers such as Amar 
Sinch. Patanjali's Mahabhashya and Amar Singh's 
Jmarkosha are the most celebrated works of its kind. 
Panchatantra, a collection of animal stories, in 
vhich animals and birds play the parts of kings, 
ministers and common men, is full of wit and humour. 
It is said that Vishnu Sharma wrote these fables to 
preach the art of statecraft to disinterested princes. 
Subsequently, these fables were adopted as Aesops 
Fables. Another book Brihat Katha by Gunadhya 
became the basis of 'Sindbad the Sailor'. 
Advancement in the Field of Science 
The science of medicine, mathematics and 
astronomy reached great heights during the Gupta 
period. 
Medicine : Vaghbhatta was the most distinguished 
physician of this period. He wrote his famous treatise 
Ashtangahridaya Samhita and continued the tradition 
of Charaka. In this period, surgeons performed 
operations of cataract, etc. Dhanavantari was also a 
great physician whose name has become synonymous 
with Ayurveda. Astanga-Sangraha, Charaka-Samhita 
and Sushruta Samhita were other important works on 
Ayurveda. Sushruta was the first surgeon of ancient 
India. Charaka was a great physician who taught at 
Taxila during the reign of Kanishka. 
Sushruta: Sushruta wrote Sushruta Samhita, 
considered to be one of the most important treatises 
on medicine. This treatise explains all aspects ot general medicine including detailed account 2 surgery. Sushruta is called father of plastic 
rgery'. Sushruta had a number of disciples who 
SE History and Civics -IX were required to study for 6 years before beginning 
surgical training. He would instruct students to 
practise cutting on vegetables or dead animnals to 
perfect the length and depth of an incision. Sushruta's 
medical prowess is exhibited through his writings 
on rhinoplasty, involving nasal reconstructions using 
skin from paticnt's check or forchead. 
Charak Sushruta 
Mathematics_ and Astronomy : The greatest 
mathematicians and astronomers of this period were 
Aryabhatta, Varahamihira and Brahmagupta. By this 
time, Indian mathematics had already discovered 
the decimal system and the use of zero which were 
later borrowed by Arabs from India. Aryabhatta, 
in this famous book Aryabhattiyam, deals with the 
rules of solving problems of Algebra, Geometry and 
Trigonometry. He even calculated the exact value of 
T (pi) which was equal to 3.1416 and formulated 
how to find the area of a triangle. Aryabhatta's other 
book, Surya Siddhanta, proves that the earth revolves 
round the sun and rotates on its axis. In this way, 
he discovered the causes of the Solar and the Lunar 
eclipses. He also measured by speculation the exact 
circumference of the earth. 
Varahamihira's celebrated work is known 
as Brihat Samhita. It deals with mathematics, 
astronomy, botany and physical geography. He 
stated that the moon moves round the earth and the 
earth together with the moon, moves round the sun. 
He also worked out the movement of the planets. His 
other works are Panch Siddhantika, Brihad Jataka 
and Laghu Jataka. 
Brahmagupta was also a great mathematician. 
His work Brahmashutika Siddhanta is composed in 
verse form. He hints at the law of gravitation.

CONTRIBUTIONS IN RIITECTVE 
The Gupta period also saw great advancement in 
the field of Architecture. Numerous beautiful tenmples 
with the Shikhara were built during this period. The 
stone temple at Deogarh (near Jhansi) and the brick 
temple at Bhitrigaon (near Kanpur) are two fine 
specimens of the period. The first contains some fine 
pieces of sculpture on the panels of its walls and 
the second is known for its well-designed figures in 
terracotta. 
The Vishnu temple at Deogarh marked a transition 
from early flat-roofed temples to the later style of 
building a Shikhara or a tower over the shrine of 
the Chief deity (Garbhagriha). This temple is erected 
on a platform accessible by a flight of steps. This 
platform is decorated with sculptures depicting scenes 
from the lives of Rama and Krishna, A remarkable

found in the Ajanta caves. These frescoes are so 
excellent in their design and technical skill that 
tourists from all over the world especially come to 
see them. The words of a Danish artist are worth 
mentioning in this connection. 
A Specimen of an Ajanta Painting 
(Bodhisatva Avalokiteshvara) 
According to him, "They represent the climax 
which the genuine Indian art has attained. Everything 
in these pictures from the composition as a whole 
to the smallest pearl or flower testifies the depth of 
insight coupled with the greatest technical skill.'" 
These frescoes of the Ajanta caves are accomplished 
in execution and beautiful in form and colour. 
Perhaps the figure of Avalokiteshvara Padmapani 
is the best known single figure from Ajanta found in 
Cave No. 1. This figure is as much known for its 
colours and designs as for its expression. The face of 
the figure clearly reflects compassion and tenderness 
which is characteristic of Padmahari whose main 
mission is to relieve human beings by taking upon 
himself the sorrows of the earthly beings. The figure 
8 set in quite a natural setting. It is surrounded by 
Gandharvas, Yakshas, Apsaras and other celestial 
eings, animals (like monkeys) and trees (like palm 
Pees). The head-dressing or jewelled crown, necklace 
nd white lotus in the right hand, all add much 
Nre to the whole scene. especially to the figures of Ttmahari or the Lotus-Bearer. 
and Civics -IX The paintings in Bagh Caves (Madhya Pradesh) 
are simnilar to those of Ajanta. They have same varicty 
of designs, vigorous execution, decorative qual√≠ty and 
secular nature. The scene depicting a procession of 
clephants and a lovely scene of a dancer and woman 
musicians are very impressive compositions. 
Metal Casting or Metallurgy 
The art of casting metals reached a high degree 
of development during the Gupta age. The Iron 
Pillar at Delhi, near the Qutab Minar, reveals the 
metallurgical skill of the Gupta artists. It has been 
exposed to sun, rain and storms for centuries yet it 
has not rusted. One may wonder how the ancient 
Indians were able to cast such a massive and heavy 
pillar in the 5h century CE. 
Iron Pillar at Mehrauli 
This pillar has a special historical importance 
of its own. This pillar bears the inscription of one 
Chandra who has been identified by the historians 
as Chandragupta Vikramaditya. It is believed 
that this iron pillar was erected by Kumargupta I 
to commemorate the achievements of his father 
Chandragupta Vikramaditya. 
The copper statue of Buddha in Nalanda is 
part of the Sultanganj Buddha statue, which is 2.5 
metre tall and weighs over 500 kilograms is the best 
specimen of the art of casting copper statues. The 
Gupta coins display a high artistic value too. They 
issued a large number of gold coins. 
Education 
India made great progress in the field of education 
during the Gupta period. In addition to the existence
