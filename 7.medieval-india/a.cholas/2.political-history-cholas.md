SECTION 2: A BRIEF POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE CHOLAS

Every dynasty has a story arc — a beginning, a peak, and a decline. The Cholas are no different. They began modestly, in the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, and grew into a mighty empire that ruled both land and sea. To understand their greatness, let us walk with their kings, one by one, pausing to see their challenges, victories, and legacy.

THE BEGINNING – VIJAYALAYA CHOLA
The Chola story in the medieval age begins with **Vijayalaya Chola** (around 850 CE).  
He was not born an emperor. He began as a **chieftain** (a small local ruler). Slowly, through war and diplomacy, he carved out space for the Cholas in Tamil Nadu. His greatest act was capturing **Thanjavur** [modern Tanjore], which he made the capital. Why Thanjavur? Because it sat at the heart of the fertile Kaveri delta — rich in rice, close to trade routes, and easy to defend.  

👉 Think of Vijayalaya as the “foundation stone.” He laid the base on which future kings would build.

HIS SUCCESSORS – PARANTAKA I
Vijayalaya’s grandson, **Parantaka I (907–955 CE)**, was a bold warrior. He conquered much of **Pandya territory** [the Pandyas ruled around Madurai] and pushed Chola influence further south. He also fought the **Cheras** and clashed with the northern powers like the **Rashtrakutas**.  
Parantaka was not just a conqueror. He gave attention to administration and temple construction, continuing the Chola tradition of blending power with piety.  

👉 Memory hook: “Parantaka = Pandya crusher.”

THE GOLDEN AGE BEGINS – RAJARAJA I (985–1014 CE)
Now comes the most celebrated of all — **Rajaraja I**, known as **Rajaraja the Great**. His reign marks the **golden age of Chola power**.  

What made him great?  
- **Military power**: He defeated the Chera navy, subdued the Pandyas, annexed Kerala’s Travancore, parts of Mysore and Coorg, fought the **Chalukyas of Vengi** in Andhra, the ruler of **Kalinga** (Odisha), and even sent expeditions to **Sri Lanka**.  
- **Administration**: He ended quarrels within the dynasty and organized the empire with efficiency.  
- **Religion & art**: His crowning achievement was the **Brihadeshwara Temple at Thanjavur**. This wasn’t just a temple — it was a political statement in granite. On its walls are inscribed his victories and donations, reminding everyone who visited that Rajaraja was both king and devotee.  
- **Navy**: Rajaraja built a strong **naval fleet** — not only to protect trade but also to project power into the Indian Ocean. He opened sea routes to the **East Indies** (today’s Indonesia) and kept control over Sri Lanka.  

👉 Memory hook: “Rajaraja = Temple Builder + Sea King.”  
He turned the Cholas into the **paramount power of South India**.

THE GLOBAL VISION – RAJENDRA I (1012–1044 CE)
If Rajaraja laid the crown, his son **Rajendra Chola I** added the jewels.  
Rajendra inherited his father’s energy and expanded the empire even further.  

- **Northern campaigns**: Rajendra’s armies marched north through Odisha and Bengal, reaching the **Ganga river**. To commemorate this, he assumed the proud title **“Gangaikonda”** (the Chola who conquered the Ganga). He even brought back **sacred water from the Ganga** and poured it into a great tank at his new capital.  
- **New capital**: He built a magnificent new city called **Gangaikonda Cholapuram** (“the city of the Chola who brought the Ganga”). Here he raised temples that rivalled his father’s Brihadeshwara in beauty.  
- **Overseas campaigns**: Rajendra is famous for sending a **naval expedition across the Bay of Bengal** to attack the kingdom of **Sri Vijaya** [Sumatra in Indonesia]. This was extraordinary — an Indian king projecting power into Southeast Asia. He also subdued the **Andaman & Nicobar Islands** and established Chola influence in the Malayan peninsula.  
- **Administration & Public works**: He was also a good organiser. Near his capital he built a **16-mile-long embankment** around an artificial lake — a huge irrigation work showing how seriously the Cholas took water management.  

👉 Memory hook: “Rajendra = Ganga conqueror + Overseas adventurer.”  
He made the Cholas a **world-class power**, admired and feared across Asia.

THE LAST SPLASH – RAJADHIRAJA (1018–1054 CE)
Next came **Rajadhiraja Chola**, who tried to hold together the vast empire. He fought bravely against the **Western Chalukyas** under Somesvara I. In 1052 CE, while personally leading his troops in battle, he was killed. His death marked the beginning of the slow **decline of Chola power**.  

After Rajadhiraja, later rulers like **Rajendra II, Virarajendra, and Adhirajendra** kept the empire alive, but it was never as glorious as under Rajaraja and Rajendra I. By the 12th century, other powers like the **Hoysalas**, **Pandyas**, and eventually northern invaders began to chip away. The final blow came when **Malik Kafur**, general of Alauddin Khalji, invaded the south in 1311 CE.  

👉 Memory hook: “Rajadhiraja = brave but fell in battle.”

WHY THIS POLITICAL STORY MATTERS
- It shows how a **small local dynasty** (Vijayalaya) became an **international empire** (Rajendra).  
- It highlights the **peak of South Indian naval power** in history.  
- It explains why the **Brihadeshwara Temple** and **Gangaikonda Cholapuram** are not just religious monuments but **symbols of political might**.  
- It teaches that no empire lasts forever — after Rajaraja and Rajendra, decline was inevitable.

MEMORY ANCHORS
• Vijayalaya = founder, made **Thanjavur** capital.  
• Parantaka I = crushed Pandyas.  
• Rajaraja I = greatest king, temple builder, sea power.  
• Rajendra I = Ganga conqueror, overseas expeditions, new capital.  
• Rajadhiraja = last great ruler, died in battle, start of decline.  

EXAM PRACTICE
- **Recall:** Who built the city of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, and why was it named so?  
- **Understand:** Why was Rajaraja I called “the Great”?  
- **Connect:** How were the overseas campaigns of Rajendra I unique compared to other Indian dynasties of the same period?
