# ðŸ“˜ Sources of Gupta History

When we try to reconstruct history, it is like piecing together a giant puzzle. Some pieces come from **books and poems**, while others come from **pillars, coins, and ruins** that still survive. Together, they allow us to imagine the world of the Guptas.

## (A) Literary Sources

### 1. Fa-Hienâ€™s Account

In the early 5th century CE, a Chinese Buddhist monk named **Fa-Hien** undertook a long journey across India. He walked through forests, crossed rivers, and visited cities like **Mathura, Kannauj, Kapilavastu, Kushinagar, Vaishali, Pataliputra, Kashi, and Rajagriha**. Though his main interest was Buddhism, he left behind valuable observations about society under the Guptas.

Fa-Hien wrote that **Magadha was prosperous**, towns were large, and people enjoyed wealth but lived simple, honest lives. **Pataliputra** stood out with its hospitals and charitable institutions funded by local citizens. Religion was diverseâ€”Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Buddhism, and Jainismâ€”but people lived in harmony. Hindu gods appeared on coins and in temple art. Punishments were mild, with most offences settled by fines.

### 2. Literary Works of Kalidasa and Vishakhadatta

The Gupta period is often called a golden age of literature. **Kalidasa**, the greatest poet and dramatist of this era, wrote masterpieces like *Abhijnanasakuntalam*, *Meghaduta*, and *Raghuvamsha*. His works reveal the sophistication of Gupta culture and court life. Another important writer, **Vishakhadatta**, composed plays such as *Devi Chandraguptam*, which describe the early life of Chandragupta II.

### 3. The Puranas

The **Puranas**, especially the *Vayu Purana*, provide historical details about dynasties, rulers, and events. Although primarily religious in nature, they help historians trace the political developments of the Guptas.

## (B) Archaeological Sources

### 1. The Allahabad Pillar Inscription

One of the most important records of Gupta history is the inscription on the **Allahabad Pillar**. Written in Sanskrit by **Harisena**, the court poet of **Samudragupta**, it describes his conquests, alliances, and policies. This single inscription has been called the foundation of Samudraguptaâ€™s fame.

### 2. The Iron Pillar of Mehrauli (Delhi)

Near the Qutub Minar in Delhi stands the famous **Iron Pillar**, remarkable for not rusting even after more than 1,600 years. Its inscription praises **Chandragupta II**, celebrated as a powerful ruler. The pillar is also a symbol of the Gupta mastery of metallurgy.

### 3. Other Inscriptions

Several other inscriptions add details to Gupta history. The inscriptions at **Basarh, Udaygiri, and Sanchi** provide information about Chandragupta II, while the **Eran inscription** records events from the reign of **Skandagupta**.

### 4. Coins

The Guptas issued an impressive variety of coins, mostly in gold. These coins often depict kings in heroic or artistic posesâ€”Samudragupta playing the veena, Chandragupta II slaying a lion, and rulers performing sacrifices. Coins reveal not only the economy but also art, religion, and political achievements of the age.

### 5. Nalanda University

Founded during the reign of **Kumaragupta**, **Nalanda University** became one of the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world. It attracted students from across India and beyond. The university had three great librariesâ€”**Ratnasagar, Ratnadadhi, and Ratnaranjak**â€”and taught subjects ranging from the Vedas to logic, grammar, medicine, and Buddhist philosophy. Later pilgrims like **Hiuen Tsang** left detailed descriptions of its grandeur.
