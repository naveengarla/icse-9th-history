EXTRA SECTION: THE CHOLAS AND US — WHY THEY STILL MATTER TODAY

History is never only about the past. The Cholas live on even today — in our language, festivals, films, temples, and pride. Let us see how.

TEMPLES THAT STILL BREATHE
Walk into the Brihadeshwara Temple in Thanjavur today, and you will not feel it is 1,000 years old. Priests still light lamps, devotees still sing hymns, dancers still perform Bharatanatyam in its courtyards.  
This is why UNESCO called it a “Great Living Chola Temple” — it is not a museum piece, it is still alive. Children visiting with their parents feel awe not because it is history, but because it still functions as it did in Rajaraja’s time.

TAMIL PRIDE
For Tamil people, the Cholas are not just kings — they are symbols of cultural pride.  
- The **Tamil Ramayana by Kamban** is still read, staged, and sung in households.  
- Nataraja, the Chola bronze of Shiva dancing, has become an **icon of Tamil identity and Indian art worldwide**. It even stands at CERN in Switzerland, the world’s largest physics laboratory, symbolising cosmic rhythm!  
- In politics and everyday talk, leaders often refer to the Cholas as proof of Tamil Nadu’s historic greatness.

MEDIA AND POP CULTURE
The Cholas have entered films, novels, and TV series.  
- The most famous is **“Ponniyin Selvan”**, a Tamil historical novel by Kalki Krishnamurthy, later turned into blockbuster movies by Mani Ratnam. It tells the story of Rajaraja Chola’s rise in a thrilling, adventurous style. Kids who find textbooks boring often fall in love with the Cholas through these stories.  
- Documentaries on Discovery and History Channel often show the engineering marvels of the Brihadeshwara temple.  
- In school competitions, children still dress up as Rajaraja Chola or recite verses from Kamban’s Ramayana.  

DAILY LIFE CONNECTIONS
- The very word **“Coromandel Coast”**, used even today in maps and weather reports, comes from “Cholamandalam” — land of the Cholas.  
- The **village panchayat system** (Gram Sabha) in India is considered a continuation of the **Chola assemblies** (Ur, Sabha, Nagattar, Nattar). When your local Gram Panchayat meets, it echoes a system started 1,000 years ago!  
- Traditional bronze-casting communities in Tamil Nadu still follow techniques perfected in the Chola period. The same families that cast Nataraja statues then are sometimes still working today.

EMOTIONS AND INSPIRATION
For many, the Cholas represent:  
- **Confidence** — that an Indian kingdom could rule the seas when Europe was still in the Dark Ages.  
- **Creativity** — temples and bronzes that even modern artists cannot replicate.  
- **Continuity** — the idea that culture lives on, not just in museums but in living traditions.

WHY THIS EXTRA SECTION MATTERS
When students see that the Cholas are not just “old kings in a textbook” but part of daily life, pride, films, and culture, they connect emotionally. History then becomes a mirror — showing us who we were, and who we still are.

MEMORY HOOKS
• Temples still active = Living history.  
• Tamil pride = Kamban’s Ramayana, Nataraja at CERN.  
• Pop culture = “Ponniyin Selvan” novels + films.  
• Coromandel = from Cholamandalam.  
• Panchayat = echo of Chola self-government.
