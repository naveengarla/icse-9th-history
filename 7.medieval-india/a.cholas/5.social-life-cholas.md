SOCIAL LIFE UNDER THE CHOLAS

The Chola society was a peaceful one. There were different sections in the society. At the same time, the society was based on varna system. According to the varna system, society was divided into four main divisions, namely Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Sudras. The poor and unprivileged people lived in modest or lower dwellings and areas. Debt-bonded and forced labour were also there. Professionals like carpenters, weavers, blacksmiths, masons, goldsmiths also lived there. Slavery also existed. There were several grades among the slaves. The detail about the sale of slaves is recorded in the inscriptions. Great social privileges and freedom prevailed among the upper classes.

Education : The temple was not only a place of worship but also of education. The priests of the temple were the local teachers as there were no separate schools. The students learnt their lessons in Sanskrit, and over the time, they incorporated many Sanskrit words into their language.

Ah üëç got it Naveen ‚Äî you mean in the **original textbook notes I rewrote** section by section.

No worries ‚Äî **Social Life under the Cholas** (what would map to `05-social-life-cholas.md`) **is very much covered**. We already did it in detail with the documentary narration.

Here‚Äôs the quick recap of that section from our notes so you can confirm:

### **Section 4: Social Life Under the Cholas**

* **Varna divisions**: Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants), Sudras (farmers/labourers).
* **Unprivileged people**: bonded labourers, forced labour, slaves (different grades).
* **Professions**: carpenters, weavers, blacksmiths, masons, goldsmiths ‚Äî often organised in guilds.
* **Slavery**: existed, with sales recorded in inscriptions.
* **Living conditions**: upper classes had privileges, lower classes lived modestly.
* **Education**: temples doubled as schools, priests as teachers, lessons in Sanskrit (with many Sanskrit words entering Tamil).
* **Temples as centres**: not only religious but also cultural, educational, and social hubs.
* **Atmosphere**: generally peaceful and stable, but inequality remained.

üëâ Memory hooks:

* Brahmins = books, Kshatriyas = battles, Vaishyas = business, Sudras = soil.
* Temples = school + library + employer + record office.
